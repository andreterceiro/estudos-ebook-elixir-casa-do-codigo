# More interesting points of the ebook

The author talks at the beginning of the e-book about Elixir running on the Erlang virtual machine.

It was created by Brazilian José Valim.

It is simpler than Erlang.

It is better suited than languages ​​in general to take advantage of the multiple cores of a processor.

The professor gave as an example of efficiency the fact that WhatsApp has a server with an application in Elixir that processes thousands of simultaneous requests and uses only half of its processing power.

The professor said that the language stands out for communication between processes, done through messages and hot swapping, which allows code to be changed without interrupting the running system.
